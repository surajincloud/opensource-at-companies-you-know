# opensource-sites-by-companies

Nowadays, every company relies on OpenSource directly or indirectly, it's very good to see that companies are coming forward and showcasing their OpenSource projects. some of them are not very well known projects but might be useful for someone.

I always like to explore and see what tools/projects are being used by companies, hence I decided to curate a list of them. 

If you have know anything, do raise a PR and contribute :)
